# Motivation and Vision

## Why we started the OceanGuardian project

We have been part of the Solana NFT community since early summer 2021 and were following all the innovation that was happening like the Metaplex Candy Machine and other tools to simplify the creation and management of NFTs. This encouraged us to move from "only" participating in the community to creating our own. When we started coming up with a concept for the OceanGuardians project, we quickly discovered that NFTs in their current form have a key limitation. Their data cannot be updated.

After realizing this, we started brain-storming for a solution. We had some long nights testing ideas and thinking about how to overcome this problem. After many failed tries and challenges to overcome, we came up with Dynamic NFTs (NFTs of which the data can be continuously changed). We researched utilities and mechanics that could be created with Dynamic NFTs and were led to the path that we are on right now.

The ocean and surfing theme comes from our teams passion for surfing and our appreciation for marine life. From the beginning we wanted to donate a part of our profits to support marine life and preserve the ecosystem our oceans. After some research we decided that our donation will be going to [Sea Shepherd](https://www.seashepherdglobal.org).

## Our Vision

We are an international team of 6 people from Austria and South Africa with a vision to push the boundaries of NFTs as we know them today. We built our technology not only to be used by our project, but to enable other projects that want to tap into Dynamic NFTs. Our project and its ecosystem will function as a proof of concept with the goal to onboard many more projects to Dynamic NFTs and Web3 in the coming months.

Wether you are building a game or a lifestyle brand, we believe every project can benefit from integrating dynamic features into their NFTs to create a more engaging and versatile experience for their community. Therefore we want to contribute to the this design space with our tools and knowledge and through that drive innovation and user-adoption to the Solana ecosystem.
