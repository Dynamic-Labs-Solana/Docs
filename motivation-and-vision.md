# Motivation and Vision

We have been part of the Solana NFT community since early summer 2021 and were following all the innovation that was happening like the Metaplex Candy Machine and other tools to simplify the creation and management of NFTs. When we started coming up with a concept for the OceanGuardians project, we quickly discovered that NFTs in their current form have a key limitation. Their data cannot be updated.

After realizing this, we started brain-storming for a solution. We had some long nights testing ideas and thinking about how to implement this change. We came up with Dynamic NFTs (NFTs of which the data can be continuously changed). We researched utilities and mechanics that could be created with Dynamic NFTs and were led to the path that we are on now.

We are an international team of 6 people from Austria and South Africa with a vision to push the boundaries of NFTs as we know them today. We built our technology not only to be used by our project, but to enable other projects that want to tap into Dynamic NFTs. Our project will function as a proof of concept with the goal to onboard many more projects to dynamic NFTs in the coming months.

Wether itâ€™s a game you are building or a lifestyle brand, we believe every project can benefit from integrating dynamic features into their NFTs to create a more engaging and versatile experience for their community. Therefore we are here to make this technology a new standard and through that contribute to evolve this space to a new level.\

This is our way of of driving innovation and user-adoption to the Solana ecosystem!
