# Trait Swap

We mentioned earlier that the OceanGuardians will have 3 visible dynamic attributes. These are the attributes that can be acquired through the Trait Swap Dashboard in our dApp.

Swapping a Trait will require $WAVE, our own utility token, that can be earned by staking or bought from an decentralised exchange. This mechanic enables us to encourage attribute swapping in order to yield higher rewards when staking or getting special rewards for quests.



A working version of our Trait Swap is already available on Solanaâ€™s devnet and we are currently looking for Beta-Testers to look for bugs and give us some feedback and thoughts. If you are interested in doing so, please reach out to us on Discord or Twitter.
