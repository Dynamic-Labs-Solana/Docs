# Roadmap

After our three main ecosystem features are implemented we have more ideas to create interesting mechanics around Dynamic NFTs. These will be explained in more detail later on but we will provide you with a short outlook:

We will create a **Trait Marketplace** on which our community will be able to trade their attributes (for example the board) with other users. This means price will be determined by demand and Dynamic Attributes will become their own assets that can be traded. NFTs can be combined and interesting mechanics can be created with relationships between many NFTs.

Speaking of the relationship of multiple NFTs we plan to create mechanics around **NFT Real Estate** in our OceanGuardian Ecosystem. If you have multiple OceanGuardians with the right skills and stats you can open a `Surf School`, a `Diving School` or a `Board Shop`. With one of these shops, you can then earn rewards for training novice OceanGuardians.

Below youâ€™ll find our roadmap that shows the dates we want to have all of these utilities ready.
