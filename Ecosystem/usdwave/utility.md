# Utility

Another big part of our ecosystem is our token **$WAVE**. In this section I want to give you more insight into our thinking around utility and tokenomics and how we are planning to make $WAVE sustainable.&#x20;



$WAVE will be distributed initially through a customized NFT staking mechanism. OceanGuardians NFT holders will be able to stake their NFT on our dApp. Like stated in the the [Staking](../gamified-ecosystem/staking.md) section, how much $WAVE you will receive is dependent on the three dynamic attributes of your OceanGuardian.

A detailed list with the multipliers of each layer will be released closer to release of our ecosystem.
{% endhint %}

Generally our ecosystem is set-up to be favouring **diamond hands** both when it comes to our NFTs and $WAVE. Our Staking program and Quest system will encourage the upgrade of your NFT in order to receive the most $WAVE in the end.&#x20;

> But why would I even want to accumulate $WAVE?

Our ecosystem with all it's features and gamifications is the gateway for our holders to earn a revenue-share off Dynamic Labs. With Dynamic Labs we are building out tooling and also incubating other NFT projects that want to dive into the possibilities of Dynamic NFTs. More on Dynamic Labs can be found in the [Dynamic Labs](../../dynamic-labs/business-model.md) section.

We are expecting within the first 3 months we'll start distributing profit back to our holders. For that we'll be setting up a special pool that will bind one OceanGuardian NFT with a not yet determined amount of $WAVE.&#x20;

While we haven't yet fixated the exact variables for the distribution of the Dynamic Labs profit-share it will definitely be of value to upgrade the attributes of your NFT and complete the missions available to you.

{% hint style="info" %}
Summary:\
To be eligible to earn a share of the revenues of Dynamic Labs you'll have to pair one OceanGuardian with a certain amount of $WAVE. The stats and attributes of your OceanGuardian will influence your share.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Ecosystem Mechanics

Now that we've given you a reason to accumulate $WAVE you will be asking how to best prepare for when we start the profit distribution. I encourage you to check out the sections about our [gamified NFT ecosystem](../gamified-ecosystem/). There you'll find most of your answers. As we roll out the features of our ecosystem we will also encourage the participation of the community in finding better strategies for $WAVE.
