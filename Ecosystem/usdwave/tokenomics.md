### Community Distribution

{% hint style="info" %}
We designed our token distribution to provider for a minimum runway of at least 10 months. This will give us time to ship our tools and products as well as work together with multiple clients to establish sustainable revenue that can be shared back to NFT and token holders.
{% endhint %}

There are fewer OceanGuardians circulating the markets than expected (555 instead of 2222). Therefore we had to adapt the daily base rate every OceanGuardian is accumulating while being staked. \
\
Initially we planned for a _daily accrual base rate of 15 $WAVE._ With about 90% of these 2,222 OceanGuardians staked, and considering that the average NFT is earning more than 15 $WAVE since you can upgrade traits that effect your return rate, the community distribution would have had a runway of approximately 10 months.

Now we have the option to decrease the _daily accrual base rate f_or every new wave of OceanGuardians is release. For every wave that is minted, we will reduce the _daily accrual base rate_ for every OceanGuardian.&#x20;

This basically means that holders of our first 555 OceanGuardians have the chance to stake their OceanGuardian for twice the $WAVE for the period until Wave #2 of our launch.

### Deflationary Mechanisms

Any investor/team tokens will undergo an extensive lockup period to ensure stability in the $WAVE ecosystem (see supply allocation).

Additionally we put multiple deflationary mechanisms in place:

1. All $WAVE spent through **Trait Purchases** will immediately be burned
2. Sending your OceanGuardian on a Quest will come at a cost ($WAVE) that will be burned
3. Staking rewards harvested before the 10-Day Grace Period will apply a 50% unstaking-tax.

{% hint style="info" %}
As we release more products like Quests, or a Trait Marketplace there will be more deflationary mechanisms announced to support the stability of our ecosystem.
{% endhint %}



### Liquidity Pool

We decided to start distributing $WAVE through staking and **will not** provide liquidity for $WAVE initially. We anticipate this to reduce sell pressure in the beginning which will be positive for the long-term future of $WAVE.\
\
As we move onto further launch waves, we are planning to open-up a liquidity pool for $WAVE and NFT holders to supply their liquidity and earn more $WAVE. More on that later!



In the end, to profit the most long-term, the way to go is to accumulate $WAVE. We are planning to distribute a profit-share from Dynamic Labs later on to both $WAVE and OceanGuardian holders. Right now we are working on a mixed pool that combines an OceanGuardian with a certain amount of $WAVE.
