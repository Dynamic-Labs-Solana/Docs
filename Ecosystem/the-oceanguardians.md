# The OceanGuardians

## What makes an OceanGuardian

The OceanGuardians are surfer, uniquely generated from over 150 different attributes. Each OceanGuardian NFT has three (visible) dynamic attributes which are the `LOCATION`, the `WAVE` and the `BOARD` and can be changed with our **Trait Swap**.

In addition to these visible attributes, each OceanGuardian can attain a `ROLE` (invisible attribute) by completing **quests**. Each of these dynamic traits offers different perks and benefits in our experimental game-fi ecosystem.



### Locations

Every OceanGuardian will be riding at one of 10 different surf locations. For the location we chose 10 memorable and famous surf spots around the world. Different locations have different chances for airdropped items and have different quests to complete.



### Waves

There are three different wave boosts you can temporarily unlock either by purchasing it or as a reward for a quest. Larger waves allow your OG to complete quests quicker and with an increased yield but they run out after a certain period of time.



### Boards

There are 15 boards which will be randomly assigned to your OceanGuardian. Boards have different perks that influence the yield return from quests and staking. After a certain amount of quests the board loses its power which reduces yield drastically. To gain back the original power you have to renew it.

You can also combine different items you attain from quests in different locations to upgrade your board permanently.





### Roles

In addition to three visible dynamic attributes, the OceanGuardians also have the ability to learn skills through Quests and take on roles.

There are 3 roles every OceanGuardian can attain: Traveler, Board Shaper & Kahuna. Each role comes with a special mechanic.

1. The Traveler will pay a reduced price for a location Transfer
2. The Board Shaper will pay a reduced price for a Board swap
3. The Kahuna will get extra rewards when riding a Big Wave
