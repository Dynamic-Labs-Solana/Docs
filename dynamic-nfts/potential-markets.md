  \-> For example the relationship between of an asset and its price\
  \
  What does that mean for NFTs?

## Potential Markets

We are still continously researching Dynamic NFTs. There is a huge potential which likly takes many months or even years to discover. With our initial research we came up with **3 major potential markets for Dynamic NFTs**:

### GAMING&#x20;

1. **GAMING**

Now we will give you some real world examples:

### REAL WORLD EVENTS

### Ad 1. Gaming

With Gaming, there are many opportunities to integrate Dynamic NFTs. For example Dynamic NFTs could display the condition of your skin / item. The more you use it, the fruther it deteriorates. Also Dynamic NFTs open up the opportunity to make NFTs interrelatable, which means that there will be a relation between each NFT. This opens up space for many innovative and new game mechanics and enables the game creators to realize all their ideas.

### GAMBLING

### Ad 2. Real World Events

Dynamic NFTs can also improve real world events and their implications. Letâ€™s say you own an NFT trading card of a football player that shows his stats. After every game the stats of your card are updated depending on goals, fouls, etc.\
Also a ticket to a sporting event can be an NFT. If you add our Dynamic features, this will enable the issuer to update the ticket even if the event is postponed.\
Dynamic NFTs could also be used for identification. Imagine your ID as an NFT, making it impossible to counterfeit. Every 5 years for example, you have to update your picture or maybe you marry and your Surname changes. With Dynamic NFTs the issuer of the digital ID could just update the metadata in real-time.
